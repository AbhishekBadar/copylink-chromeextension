## üîê Permission Justifications

### Required Permissions in manifest.json:
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "contextMenus", 
  "storage",
  "notifications",
  "tabs"
]
```

### Detailed Justification for Each Permission:

#### 1. **activeTab**
**Purpose**: Access the current active tab to read the URL and page title
**Justification**: Essential for the core functionality of copying the current page's URL. This permission allows the extension to read the URL and title of the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension button or uses the context menu. Without this permission, the extension cannot fulfill its primary purpose of copying URLs.
**User Benefit**: Enables one-click URL copying from any webpage

#### 2. **contextMenus**
**Purpose**: Add "Copy URL" options to the right-click context menu
**Justification**: Provides users with convenient access to URL copying functionality through right-click menus on any webpage. This enhances user experience by offering multiple ways to access the core functionality without requiring toolbar interaction.
**User Benefit**: Quick access to copy functionality via right-click menu

#### 3. **storage**
**Purpose**: Store user preferences, copy history, and floating button position
**Justification**: Necessary to remember user settings such as copy history limits, preferred copy formats, and the position of the draggable floating button. All data is stored locally and never transmitted to external servers.
**User Benefit**: Personalized experience with persistent settings and copy history

#### 4. **notifications**
**Purpose**: Show copy confirmation messages to users
**Justification**: Provides visual feedback when URLs are successfully copied, improving user experience by confirming that the action was completed. These are brief, non-intrusive notifications that appear only when the user performs a copy action.
**User Benefit**: Clear confirmation that URL copying was successful

#### 5. **tabs**
**Purpose**: Access tab information for URL and title retrieval
**Justification**: Required to read the URL and page title from browser tabs to enable the core copying functionality. This permission works in conjunction with activeTab to provide complete URL copying capabilities.
**User Benefit**: Accurate URL and title information for copying in various formats
